# Interactive Kernel Lock Simulator for Deadlock Detection and Visualization

This project is a Streamlit-based visual simulator designed to demonstrate how multithreaded systems may encounter deadlocks due to improper lock management. It draws inspiration from recent IEEE research and uses lock graphs, timeline simulations, and runtime analysis to visualize concurrency issues.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Simulate kernel-style thread and lock behavior
- Visualize lock graphs and detect deadlocks
- Step-through timeline of thread execution
- Analyze static and dynamic lock usage
- Educational and interactive web interface

## ðŸ“Œ To Create a Virtual Environment (step-by-step)

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to your project folder
cd kernel_lock_simulator

# Step 2: Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Step 3: Activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 4: Install requirements
